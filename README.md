# Windows-Applications-Development-Final-Project
This project was my final for a Windows Applications Development course in the spring of 2016.

The goal of this project was to recreate my school's class registration system to the best of my ability.
This is heavily based off of my CS-172 final project because I wanted to focus on building a working user interface.

Note that the project is heavily FileIO based because at the time I had no database experience.

UPDATE: Currently in the design process for making this project connected to a database instead of using fileIO.
